### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my slightly less-chaotic GitHub :octocat: account. My [personal account](https://github.com/darrell24015) is a complete mess with over 50 repositories scattered over dozens of topics.

âš¡ Fun fact: I have multiple Blogs in various stages of incompleteness (is that a real word?):
[Roanoke Hobby Sketchbook Blog](http://roanokehobby.github.io/Sketchbook/) and [Roanoke Hobby Robots Blog](https://roanokehobby.github.io/Robots/) are just two fine examples.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on and learning Python from the ground up.  I've tinkered with it quite a bit, but now trying to take a deeper dive into the language.

:space_invader: I really enjoy retro 8-bit games, especially on the [Arduboy](https://arduboy.com/) platform. Hope to some day actually write a cool game myself.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: darrell at roanokehobby dot net will go it.
