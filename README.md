### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ Fun fact: I have multiple Blogs in various stages of incompleteness (is that a real word?):
[Roanoke Hobby Sketchbook Blog](http://roanokehobby.github.io/Sketchbook/) and [Roanoke Hobby Robots Blog](https://roanokehobby.github.io/Robots/) are just two fine examples. Maybe later I'll add a more complete list of all the various pages hosted on GitHub.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on and learning Python from the ground up.  I've tinkered with it quite a bit, but now trying to take a deeper dive into the language.

I enjoy retro 8-bit games, especially on the [Arduboy](https://arduboy.com/) platform. Hope to some day actually write a cool game myself. But then again, maybe I'll never get around to that.  I am old, after all.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: darrell at roanokehobby dot net will do it.
